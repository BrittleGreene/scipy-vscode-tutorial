## Structure of this repository
This repository contains a [Dev Container](https://containers.dev/) setup that provides [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda) and [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) for setting up Python environments.
This repo contains a sample Conda environment file ([environment.yml](environment.yml)), demo Jupyter notebook, and Dev Container configuration files that describe how a containerized development can be built for the repo.
These configuration files work for both local Dev Containers as well as [Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), a GitHub-hosted cloud environment.

The Docker setup for the Dev Container starts with a miniconda image that then will install whatever conda environment file you have at the root of the repo.
There are some additional configuration options in the comments of the [Docker](.devcontainer/Dockerfile) and [devcontainer.json](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) that have some examples of other steps you may want to add to your Dev Container, like what VS Code extensions to install when the container is launched.
